    <p>My skills include data analysis in Python, R and SQL; web-development with React.js and Bootstrap; visualization in d3.js and Tableau; mapping in Leaflet.js, Folium and QGIS; and general design in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.</p>
  <p>I'm also a journalist and have been in and out of newsrooms for the past six years of my life. I started out at my high school newspaper, <i>The Granite Bay Gazette</i>, and eventually became editor-in-chief. I joined UC Berkeley's student-run newspaper, <i>The Daily Californian</i>, in my first semester of freshman year, and have since written more than 100 articles for the publication. I've been a news editor and covered the Student Government and Academics &amp; Administration beats at the Daily Cal, and specialized in covering sexual misconduct within A&amp;A. Currently, I'm a senior staff reporter working on longer, more investigative stories, and a data projects developer.</p>

  <p>In the past, I've worked at Intuit as a data analyst intern and at Elin.ai as a data science intern. I've also done research at UC Berkeley's d-Lab, and am currently conducting research at the Human Rights Center.</p>
