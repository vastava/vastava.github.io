    <section class="text">
      <p>My bread and butter is data analysis and modeling using the Pydata stack (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn), but I am proficient in R and SQL as well. I am also proficient in web dev with React, Angular and Bootstrap, and data visualization in d3, Tableau and QlikView.</p> 
      <p>In my downtime, I like to make interactive maps with Leaflet.js, Mapbox GL JS and QGIS. I also like to write up data science tutorials and post them on Medium.</p>
      <p>I am currently a data scientist at Thermo Fisher Scientific, and was previously a data and visualization engineer for HiGeorge, a YC startup. Before that, I've worked at Intuit as a data analyst intern and at Elin.ai as a data science intern.</p>
      <p>I'm also a storyteller and have been in and out of newsrooms for the past six years of my life. I started out at my high school newspaper, where I eventually became editor-in-chief. I joined UC Berkeley's student-run newspaper, <i>The Daily Californian</i>, in my first semester of freshman year, and have since written more than 100 articles for the publication. I've been a news editor and covered the Student Government and Academics &amp; Administration beats at the Daily Cal, and specialized in covering sexual misconduct within A&amp;A. All of this to say that I am passionate about the intersection of data analysis and peopleâ€™s stories.</p>
